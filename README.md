# Analysis of Student Performance using Machine Learning.
<hr>
Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP). Key highlights:

<li>Studied and Predicted student performance in secondary education (high school) by applying ML models and presented insights.
<li>Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.
<li>Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms, Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Bagging, and Boosting.
<li>Compared the results to recommend the best Regression model.
